# Semantic-AD
This is the official implementation of Interpretable and Generalizable Diffusion Planning via Vision-Language Guidance and Agent-Aware Trajectory Initialization.The code will be released upon acceptance.
📣 Overview
We propose a novel vision-language guided diffusion planner for autonomous driving, integrating:
- High-level semantic driving instructions extracted by a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2.5-VL)
- Agent-aware spatial distribution cues projected onto the BEV map
- Dynamic trajectory initialization for more structured and adaptive planning
- Conditional diffusion decoding for robust, interpretable, and intent-aligned trajectory generation
Our framework significantly improves intent alignment, safety, generalizability, and interpretability across diverse driving scenarios.
